TITLE OF PROJECT = The Proportion of STEM and Non-STEM Students within UK Universities.

NB: this is my first large python coding project and using a GitHub repository.

This assignment was conducted using a dataset from HESA the website link -> (https://www.hesa.ac.uk/data-and-analysis/students/where-from).    

I have attempted data visualisation for the dataframe, with some nice graphs and some needs-improvement graphs.  Applying PEP-8 guidelines to my code.  

The primary aim was to observe the distribution of STEM and non-STEM students within UK universities.  Additionally, the study utilised students country of origin to observe the number of students studying a STEM course. 

This project used the following modules:
- pandas
- matplotlib.pyplot
- numpy 
- scipy.stats
- seaborn (a tiny bit)
